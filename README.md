## Description
#First cell#
The program starts with a few inputs asking for the users name and age. The input asking the age uses .format() to add the variable name when it appears in brackets. It then repeats the users age and name with enthusiasm.

#Second cell#
The next part asks for a the users preference of cats vs. dogs. It then tells an interesting fact about the animal of the users chosing.
